let biographyText = "Axel Wenner-Gren was a prominent Swedish entrepreneur and industrialist, best known for his significant contributions to the development of household appliances. Born on June 5, 1881, in Uddevalla, Sweden, Wenner-Gren became internationally recognized for his role in the growth of Electrolux, a leading global appliance manufacturer.\n\nWenner-Gren was instrumental in transforming Electrolux into a household name, largely due to his pioneering efforts in marketing and expanding the company's product lines, notably vacuum cleaners and refrigerators. His innovative strategies included door-to-door sales and payment plans, which made Electrolux products more accessible to a broader market.\n\nAside from his industrial pursuits, Wenner-Gren was also known for his involvement in various philanthropic and humanitarian projects. During World War II, he attempted to mediate peace efforts, though his perceived ties to Nazi Germany marred his reputation in some circles.\n\nWenner-Gren was a man of diverse interests and investments, spanning industries such as shipping, aviation, and real estate. He passed away on November 24, 1961, leaving behind a complex legacy that included both significant industrial advancements and controversies related to his wartime activities."
